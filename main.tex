\begin{abstract}
  The Solera system is an orderly way to blend sherry wines.
  There is a lack of formal studies on the actual age of sherry wines.
  Assuming we take the average of all liquids that constitute a sherry wine, we can derive the actual age of sherry wines.
  We show that for $k < 11$ there is an asymptotic limit to the age of the sherry wine, but with $k > 11$, the age becomes unbounded.
  This raises questions of whether Sherry producers are accurately reporting the age of their wines.

The model is very ideal, doesn't consider evaporation mechanics and how transpiration works through the barrel.
