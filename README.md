# parallel-non-comparison-sort

We introduce a non-comparison based sort that runs in linear time, with fixed number bit size, and logic gates of linear size.
We show that this sort can be implemented with very simple hardware components, which makes it a good candidate for a sorting algorithm on ASICs or FPGAs.

## TODO

- Draw diagrams in paper
- Create a code implementation to describe how the sorting works
