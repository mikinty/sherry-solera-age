# Average Age of Sherry in the Solera System

The Solera system is an orderly way to blend sherry wines.
There is a lack of formal studies on the actual age of sherry wines.
Assuming we take the average of all liquids that constitute a sherry wine, we can derive the actual age of sherry wines.
We show that for $k < 11$ there is an asymptotic limit to the age of the sherry wine, but with $k > 11$, the age becomes unbounded.
This raises questions of whether Sherry producers are accurately reporting the age of their wines.
